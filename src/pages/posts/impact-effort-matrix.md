# Impact-effort matrix

In my [previous post](/posts/welcome), I discussed my goals. Today I will talk about a relevant thing powerful mental model that helps prioritize tasks effectively, it's called: impact-effort matrix. This simple yet insightful mental model allows you to allocate your time and energy efficiently by evaluating tasks based on their impact and effort.

The impact-effort matrix is a prioritization tool used to assess tasks based on the effort required and the value they provide. By categorizing tasks into four quadrants. It helps ensure that time and resources are spent where they will be most effective.

1. High Impact, Low Effort --> Quick Wins
   - These tasks provide significant benefits with minimal effort. They should be prioritized since they deliver quick results and require fewer resources. Completing these first can build momentum and create immediate improvements.
   - Examples include minor UX/UI tweaks that improve usability, fixing a simple but critical bug, automating a repetitive task that saves hours of work, and refining onboarding steps to boost user retention.
2. High Impact, High Effort --> Major Projects
   - These tasks are essential for long-term success but demand substantial effort. They typically require strategic planning, collaboration, and significant resources. While they take longer to complete, their impact justifies the investment.
   - Examples include developing a new product feature, overhauling a website’s design for better performance, expanding into a new market or launching an ad campaign, and implementing a new company-wide workflow or tool.
3. Low Impact, Low Effort --> Fill-ins
   - These tasks don’t move the needle much but are simple and quick to complete. They can be handled in downtime or between higher-priority tasks. While they don’t require much effort, they can still contribute to efficiency and organization.
   - Examples include organizing digital files or cleaning up a workspace, replying to routine emails, minor UI adjustments that don't drastically impact usability, and updating documentation or fixing small inconsistencies.
4. Low Impact, High Effort --> Thankless Tasks
   - These tasks consume a lot of time and energy without delivering proportional benefits. They can often be delegated, simplified, or eliminated. Recognizing and avoiding them helps prevent wasted effort.
   - Examples include attending unnecessary meetings with no clear objectives, manually inputting data when automation is possible, overcomplicating a workflow instead of optimizing it, and spending excessive time perfecting minor, non-critical details.

In my case, I can focus more on doing projects, as they fall into the Major Projects category, unlike wasting time configuring my terminal setup, which belongs in the Thankless Tasks category.

I hope it’s not just me who finds this useful, as this seems like a simple yet powerful tool for prioritizing—especially useful when we have limited time and don’t want to waste any of it (I think that’s a general thing for everyone, lol). I haven’t used it yet, but I think it will be a game-changer to look at things through this lens.

Don’t hate me, plz! I’m just trying to teach others while learning myself. That’s sometimes called the Feynman Technique, which comes from a famous physics teacher who actively promoted this method.

I think that’s it for today! I’ve already said too many things that aren’t directly related to this topic, so until next time!
