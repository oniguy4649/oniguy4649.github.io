# Welcome

Hey everyone!

This is the beginning of my blog, where I'll be documenting my journey in programming, focusing on technical and project-oriented posts. My goal is to solidify my knowledge through practical work, and I'll be sharing insights, challenges, and lessons learned along the way.

## My programming focus

I aim to become proficient in four programming languages. Top companies don’t care about specific languages—they are just tools that can be replaced and learned. So, I picked these because I personally like them:

- **C++** – A powerful language that covers everything I’ll ever need for low-level development. I could’ve chosen C, but writing everything from scratch every time feels like a hassle. Since C++ allows writing in a C-like style, it’s a solid choice.
- **Python** – A highly productive language that can handle almost anything, making it indispensable for rapid development.
- **JavaScript** – The dominant language for the web. As technology increasingly moves toward the browser, mastering JavaScript is essential.
- **Swift** – I love the idea of having deep control over macOS development. Swift builds on top of C++ knowledge and is excellent for UI applications, with plenty of built-in features that make development efficient.

## Projects I plan to build

To bridge the gap between my theoretical knowledge and practical experience, I’ll be working on the following:

- **Compiler**
- **Malloc implementation**
- **Garbage collector**
- **Database**
- **Virtual machine**
- **Chat application**
- **Text editor**
- **Web server**
- **Shell**
- **Frontend framework**

These projects will challenge me to deeply understand the inner workings of software systems while improving my problem-solving skills.

## My initial goal

I have strong theoretical knowledge but lack extensive practical experience. My goal, for now, is transition from Junior to Middle Engineer level in a short time by focusing on key skills:

#### 1. Core technical mastery

- Master my chosen languages and frameworks.
- Learn debugging, testing, and CI/CD pipelines.
- Gain experience with databases (SQL/NoSQL), APIs, and cloud platforms.

#### 2. Code quality & Collaboration

- Learn to write clean, maintainable code.
- Learn code review best practices.
- Get comfortable with Git workflows and version control strategies.

#### 3. System design basics

- Learn common design patterns (MVC, Observer, Singleton).
- Practice breaking down projects into tasks.
- Work on projects I included earlier.

#### 4. Ownership & Communication

- Improve time estimation and communication skills.
- Shadow senior engineers to learn real-world software practices.

This blog will serve as a personal roadmap, journal, and place to share my progress. If you're on a similar journey, I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences, feel free to contact me on socials or email. Let’s build cool things together!
